At a meeting at Quarto Deserto this Monday morning, after the formation of Paredão, Fred took the opportunity to recall some moments he lived with Domitila Barros at the White Room last week.

The influencer quotes a speech by the activist and says that he will call her in the Game of Discord.

"She took it and said 'I didn't get Anjo and I didn't get Líder, but I've already moved this game a lot here, because whoever gets Anjo and Líder comes to consult me.

And I decide things.

If I wanted, Lari would be out there enjoying life in her direct, I wouldn't even be with you'", quotes Fred, stating that Domitila said this inside the car in the White Room.

"I don't even know where she, as a woman, says this kind of thing", completes the journalist.

The story leaves the brothers and sisters of the Fourth Desert amazed.

"If she wanted it, I was out there.

Not even Brazil would have a vote.

If she wanted, I was out there", says Larissa.
